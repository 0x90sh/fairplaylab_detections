# FairplayLab Bible

A down-to-earth, hands-on guide to understanding and combating game cheats—no moralizing, just pure technical exploration.

---

## Overview

The FairplayLab Bible demystifies how cheats work and how to stop them. Rather than vague theories, it provides real, runnable examples—like detecting subtle mouse-movement tweaks from an aimbot or observing how a wallhack hijacks DirectX calls. Load each proof-of-concept, test it, and learn the mechanics from the inside out. Whether you’re building anti-cheat defenses or diving into hacking challenges, this open-source project empowers you to explore the technical feats without judgment.

* **For anti-cheat developers**: Learn to spot and neutralize every trick in the cheater’s toolbox.
* **For cheat creators & enthusiasts**: Gain deep insights into game internals, DirectX hooks, kernel manipulation, and more.

> “No moral high ground. No product shaming. Only hard-core proof-of-concepts and challenge-driven exploration.”

## Features

* **Real-world examples, ready to run**

  * Spot an aimbot’s subtle mouse-movement patterns.
  * Watch a wallhack intercept and modify DirectX calls in real time.
  * Explore kernel-mode hooks with hands-on demos.

* **Clear explanations + source code**

  * Step-by-step breakdown of each cheat vector (memory hacks, API hooks, network tampering, etc.).
  * Annotated C++/Python snippets that you can compile, run, and modify.

* **Dual-purpose learning**

  * Anti-cheat engineers learn detection techniques and best practices.
  * Security researchers and cheat creators experiment safely, honing reverse-engineering and hooking skills.

* **No judgment—pure technical focus**

  * We don’t label tools “good” or “bad.” Instead, we dive into the nuts and bolts of game hacking and defense.
  * Curiosity and respectful exploration are encouraged.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Windows 10/11** (64-bit) for most examples (DirectX, kernel hooks).
* **Visual Studio 2019/2022** (Desktop C++) or similar compiler toolchain.
* **Python 3.8+** with OpenCV, Scapy, and PyAutoGUI for scripting demos.
* Basic understanding of C/C++, WinAPI, and assembly is recommended but not mandatory.
